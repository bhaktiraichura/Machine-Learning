##Airfare Price prediction
One of the best-known sectors in the world, aviation has a complicated price structure that is primarily preserved only within the proprietary. Through the years, we have witnessed a significant rise in airline prices and how it has been affected by various factors. According to Holzhauer (2022), there has been a 25% rise in flight tickets since 1989 and it increased upto 18.6% in April 2022. Even frequent flyers have trouble finding pricing patterns. Customers want to pay the least amount feasible for their ticket, while airlines strive to maximize their earnings.
 The goal of our study is to analyze this dynamic pricing idea using machine learning models and real data that has been gathered from numerous travel websites like Expedia and Kayak with variables like source, destination city, airline class, and many more. Both the airline firm and the clients can use the conclusions drawn to meet their individual objectives, such as understanding rate variations and forecasting costs to reduce spending. Finding this trend and helping the users to find the best time and carrier to book a flight for a less expensive rate would be a great practical application of our research.
